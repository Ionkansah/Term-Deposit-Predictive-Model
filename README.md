## Term Deposit Subscription Prediction
This project aims to develop a predictive model to determine the likelihood of a client subscribing to a term deposit based on operational data. As part of our data analytics team, the goal is to leverage data-driven insights to support business objectives and enhance marketing strategies.

# Objectives
The primary objective is to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit, indicated by the variable "y" as "yes" or "no." The project involves several key steps:

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
1. Identify patterns and correlations within the dataset.
2. Perform necessary data preprocessing, including handling missing values, outliers, and data normalization.

# Feature Engineering:
1. Evaluate the relevance of existing features for predicting client subscriptions.
2. Create new features if applicable to improve model performance.

# Building a Predictive Model:
Implement a machine learning algorithm of choice to build a model that predicts subscription outcomes.

# Model Performance Evaluation:
Assess model effectiveness using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Address any class imbalances through techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or adjusting class weights.

# Findings and Insights:
1. Summarize key findings from the EDA and model insights.
2. Highlight impactful features, common characteristics of clients likely to subscribe, and provide actionable recommendations for the marketing team.

## Technologies Used
clients, subscriptions, term deposits, loans, marketing
